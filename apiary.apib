# General
* All coordinates are in the WGS84 system, in longitude, latitude order with units of decimal degrees. Example for a location in Berlin: *[13.387444, 52.523969]*
* Dates and time are represented in RFC-3339 format with an optional time zone offset. Example: *"2014-07-10T14:23:11+02:00"*
* Connect supports English and German and defaults to English. Integrated services may support additional languages but may also not translate all content from their default language. The language can be set in the `Accept-Language` header. Example: *de-DE* or *de*
* Parts of the response data structure might be omitted if the information is not available. Example: A car sharing operator might not provide the fuel type of its cars

# Metadata
The data provided by Connect originates from various integrated services. These are bundled into different mobility categories which are structured as resources.  

Usually, a resource request returns a response with a common metadata header. For each integrated service relevant to this request, the metadata header contains a field that describes general information regarding the respective service and its provider. Such information includes a service specific alias name, site URI, data refresh timestamp, and warning or error messages.
Warning messages are provided when request attributes are ignored or unsupported by the integrated services. Error messages refer to failures occuring during interaction with these services.

Range of values are `PublicTransit`, `Train`, `RegioTrain`, `CityTrain`, `Metro`, `Tram`, `Bus`, `Ferry`, `Gondola`, `Car`, `Bike`, `Walk`, `Other` and `Unknown`. `PublicTransit`is a generic value for public transport modes of unknown type. `Bike` subsumes `BikeSharing` and `OwnBike`. `Car` subsumes `CarSharing` and `OwnCar`. Other is used in segments with start/stop procedures for car/bike sharing, car rental, and car parking.  | yes
description | String | Contains a short textual description of this trip | yes
costs | Array | Indicates the costs of this trip including distance, duration, price, and CO2 emmision. The duration may be based on real-time information. | yes

Objects `origin` and `destination` include the following attributes:

response attribute | json data type | comments | supported by all integrated services
--- | --- | --- | ---
location | Object | GeoJson object of type `Point` in longitude, latitude order | yes 
address | String | Address of location or name of public transport station | yes
level | String | Level inside building | no
time | DateTime | Scheduled time of departure or arrival | yes
type | String | `TimedLocation`or `PublicTransportTimedLocation` | yes

In case of `PublicTransportTimedLocation`, additional attributes are included:

response attribute | json data type | comments | supported by all integrated services
--- | --- | --- | ---
stationID | String |Station ID of Connect | yes
direction | String | | no
platform | String | Scheduled platform | no
expectedPlatform | String | Real-time platform | no
expectedTime | DateTime | Real-time arrival or departure time | no


Notes:
- Some integrated services can calculate routes in the past
- Travel times for some `trafficTypes` may contain extra times. Example: 2 minutes set-up time and 1 minute return time for free-floating car sharing and bike sharing; 2 minutes set-up time and 0 minutes return time for station-based car and bike sharing, 5 minutes parking time for free-floating car sharing and own car.

    [Trip Proposals with Basic Info. Intermodal Routing][]


## Trip Proposal with Detailed Info [/imp-endpoint/api/V2/TripProposals/IMR/{proposalId}]
A single trip proposal object with detailed information. A trip proposal consists of one or more segments, each segment has one trafficType. 
Successive segments may have the same trafficType. Each segment has an origin and a destination with corresponding timestamps when to arrive and depart.
A segment can contain a a sequence of wayPoints and guidingPoints.
A wayPoint describes an intermediate geo location useful for displaying a trip course in a map.
A guidingPoint can be an intermediate public transport station or a turn-by-turn instruction. It gives a traveler hints on how to travel, e.g. whenever to change the road at a crossing. GuidingPoints are a subset of wayPoints.

The data structure of the trip proposal with detailed info contains the following attributes:

attribute | json data type | comments
--- | --- | ---
url | URI | URI to request more details
segments | Array of Objects | List of route segments
--- | --- | ---
segmentId | Number | Index of segment
description | String | Contains a short textual description of the segment
origin | Object | Contains the start location and departure time of this segment, as well as station details in case of a public transport station 
destination | Object | Contains the start location and departure time of this segment, as well as station details in case of a public transport station
trafficType | Enum | Traffic type used in the segment. Range of values are Train, RegioTrain, CityTrain, Metro, Tram, Bus, Ferry, Walk, Car, Bike, Other, Gondola and Unknown. Other is used in segments with start/stop procedures for car/bike sharing, car rental, and car parking. 
line | String | line information for a public transport segment
notes | Array of Objects | note information for a public transport segment
cost | Object | Costs of the segment including distance, duration, price, and CO2 emmision in the provided units.
wayPoints | Object | List of way points to render the segment in a map. This information is not yet available for all services.
guidingPoints | Object | List of guiding points with intermediate public transport stops or turn-by-turn instructions for walking, cycling, and driving. This information is not yet available for all services.

For a car and bike-sharing-segments "operatorId" and "unitId" are provided. For public transport segments "stationId", and "direction" are provided. For Train, RegionTrain, and CityTrain, and Metro-segments "platform" and "expectedPlatform" may be provided.


Note: The trip proposals as returned by *[POST /imp-endpoint/api/V2/TripProposals/IMR]* are internally stored only for a certain time; afterward they expire and details are no longer available. The current expiration time is 10 minutes. Trip proposals can be based on real-time-data and should not be kept longer than necesseary.

# Group Heatmap
This is a group of all REST resources related to request heatmaps as PNG files. A heat map is a graphical representation of data where the individual values are represented as colors.
Currently it is used to represent distribution of the resouces of two service categories, Car and Bike Sharing.

## CarSharing Heatmap [/imp-endpoint/api/V2/Info/Heatmap/CarSharing{?date}{?left_lower_lat}{?left_lower_lng}{?right_upper_lat}{?right_upper_lng}{?width}{?height}]    
Get WMS PNG file for carSharing for a specific date (in the past, current date or in the future) and for a specific bounding box (place).
If the date is in the past, the returned image with green areas represents historical data of car sharing availability, if the date is in the future, the returned image with blue dots represents a prediction of car sharing availability. This interface is deprecated.
