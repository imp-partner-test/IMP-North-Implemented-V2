##Metadata
Mobility Providers are able to access the services of various service providers via the unified REST interface of SiMobility Connect.
The integrated services of different mobility categories are structured as resources. Usually a response to a resource request contains a metadata header which is common for all resources.
For each provided service, relevant for this request, the metadata header containes a field that describes general information regarding subscribed service provider(s) and the requested resources. Such information includes service specific short-name, site URI, data refresh timestamp, and warning or error messages.
Warning messages are provided when request paramters are ignored or unsupported by the integrated services. Error messages refer to failures occuring during interaction with these services.

The metaData structure contains the following attributes: 

attribute | json data type | comments
--- | --- | ---
serviceAlias | String | Short name of the service offering
webUiUrl | String | URI of the service provider to obtain further information
lastUpdateTime | DateTime | Timestamp when the provided data was refreshed
messages | Array | Array of strings with warnings and error messages e.g. "message": "This service is not available in the requested region" or "code": "cost.functions.not.supported".

# Group Bike Sharing
This is a group of all bike sharing related REST resources.
    
## Bike Sharing Stations [/imp-endpoint/api/V2/Resources/BikeSharing/Stations?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={radius}&filter={filter}]    
This collection contains a list of all bike sharing stations in an area of interest specified by query parameters.
The area of interest can be defined as:

* an (optional) bounding circle (lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={radius})
* an (optional) bounding box (left_lower_lat={min_lat}&left_lower_lng={min_lng}&right_upper_lat={max_lat}&right_upper_lng={max_lng})
* an (optional) full text filter (filter={filter})

The (optional) If-Modified-Since can be set to a specific date-time in order to request only resources modified after a particular date-time.
Date-time is in HTTP date format for, e.g. Wed, 09 Apr 2008 23:55:38 GMT.

The data structure of the response contains the following attributes: 

attribute | json data type | comments
--- | --- | ---
metaData | Object | List of service providers and the last update times and failures if any [{serviceAlias:"XXX",lastUpdateTime:dd-mm-yyyyThhmmssZ,messages:[]}]
--- | --- | ---
resources | Array | Array of resources within the area of interest
--- | --- | ---
actions | Array | Available actions
id | Number | Internal bike sharing station identification number
description | String | Approximate location
type | String | Type of bike sharing station
uri | URI | URI to request more details.
location | Object | Standard GeoJSON with 'Point' geometry type. { "type": "Point", "coordinates": ["longitude":Number, "latitude":Number] }
provider | String | Service provider
availability | Double | Availability in percentage
operator | String | Resource operator
phoneNo | String | 
operatorURI | String |
operatorName | String | Resource operator
address | Object | 
numberOfBikes | Number | Number of bikes or storing positions
numberOfFreeBikes | Number | Number of currently available bikes
services | Array | 
modFlag | Enum | Type of modification to resource [New / Modified / Relocated / Deleted]. This attribute is present only when the If-Modified-Since header is passed in the request.

Parts of the data structure might be omitted if the information is not available.

This is a group of all car sharing related rest resources.

## List of Car Sharing Locations with Basic Info [/imp-endpoint/api/V2/Resources/CarSharing/All?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={radius}&f_cars={f_carsJson}] 

This collection contains a list of available car sharing locations in an area of interest specified by the query parameters (both free-floating cars and/or car sharing stations) 
with basic information and an URI to acquire more details.
In case of station-based cars, only the URI of the Car Sharing station is returned; in case of free-floating cars, the URI to the car itself is returned.
The area of interest can be defined as:

* an (optional) bounding circle (lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={radius})
* an (optional) bounding box (left_lower_lat={min_lat}&left_lower_lng={min_lng}&right_upper_lat={max_lat}&right_upper_lng={max_lng})

The optional filter `f_cars` can be used to get only car sharing stations providing cars with a specific `fuelType`, `provider` and `operator`.

The (optional) If-Modified-Since can be set to a specific date-time in order to request only resources modified after a particular date-time. Date time in HTTP date format for e.g. Wed, 09 Apr 2008 23:55:38 GMT

# Group Public Transport
This is a group of all public transportation related REST resources.

## List of Public Transport Stations with Basic Info [/imp-endpoint/api/V2/Resources/PublicTransport/Stations?lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={radius}&f_stations={f_stations}&filter={filter}] 

This collection contains a list of public transport stations with basic information in a specified area.
The area of interest can be defined as:

* an (optional) bounding circle (lat={lat}&lng={lng}&radius={radius})
* an (optional) bounding box (left_lower_lat={min_lat}&left_lower_lng={min_lng}&right_upper_lat={max_lat}&right_upper_lng={max_lng})

The optional filter `f_stations` can be used to get the stations with a particular `stationType`.

The (optional) If-Modified-Since can be set to a specific date-time in order to request only resources modified after a particular date-time. Date-time is in HTTP date format, e.g. Wed, 09 Apr 2008 23:55:38 GMT.

## Booking a taxi [/imp-endpoint/api/V2/Resources/TaxiService/Taxis/Process?action=Book] 

Book a Taxi: The taxi ride is specified by providing the starting point (address and/or geo location) and the destination.
This means that no specific, previously selected taxi is booked.

Input in request body: 
operator: name, userId and password (for authentication),
origin of the taxi ride and optional start time,
destination of the taxi ride.

Further parameters might detail the request by specifying the number of passengers, availability of child seats, extra luggage etc.

The response contains the estimated costs, the taxi's licence id, and a booking id; the latter can be used to cancel the booking.

Please note: 
Since data about the traveler is usually requested by the taxi SP, we assume that the end-user (or the mobility provider) himself is responsible to register at the service provider.
We currently require one operator in the input body.
If booking is not possible, the response body explains the reason why.

### Getting Trip Proposals by IMR Planner  [POST]
@testable

Selection criteria for trip proposals is specified in the request body as described in the sample request with the following attributes:

attribute | json data type | comments
--- | --- | ---
origin | Object | Start point specified by a geo location; level parameter is optional, to provide level information, e.g."level":"2". Addresses can be converted into geo locations by means of "GET /Resources/GeoLocations". Required parameter. 
destination | Object | End point specified by a geo location; level parameter is optional, to provide level information, e.g."level":"2". Required parameter.
time | String | Date and time of the trip. Default time is the current server time.
departureTime | Boolean | Specifies whether the time is used as departure or arrival time. If not provided then it will get as departure time by default.
viaPoints | Array of Objects | List of geolocations the route should pass in the given sequence. Not supported by all services.
costFunctions | Array of Objects | List of cost factors, i.e. distance, duration, price, and CO2-emission, each with a percentaged weight. Example: {"costType":"Duration","percentage":"100"}. The trip proposals are ranked according to this cost function. Attribute is not supported by all services. Default cost functions are specified by the individual services. 
userId | String | Traveler id that requests a trip. Traveler ids from this collection are currently not used and can be any string.
trafficTypes | Array | List of traffic types to be considered in the search for trip proposals. Results may not contain all modes. Range of values are Train, RegioTrain, CityTrain, Metro, Tram, Bus, Ferry, Walk, Bike, BikeSharing, OwnBike, Car, CarSharing, and OwnCar. Bike and Car subsume BikeSharing and OwnBike or CarSharing and OwnCar respectively. Not all trafficTypes may be supported.
routingConstraints | Array of Objects | List of constraints to be considered in the search for trip proposals. Min and max values are specified for the indvidual traffic types walk, car, and bike. Example for a maximal distance in meters the traveler agrees to walk: {"routingConstraintType": "Distance", "trafficType": "Walk", "min": { "value": 0,"unit": "meter" }, "max":{"value":600, "unit":"meter"}}
ownVehicles | Array of Objects | List of own vehicles to be considered in calculation of route alternatives. Due to the ranking according to the cost function, own vehicles may not be used in the resulting route alternatives. Sample object value {"trafficType":"Car", "useParking":true,"useParkAndRide":false, "location":{"type": "Point", "coordinates": [13.064472900000055, 52.3905689]}}. Per default the default values of the individual routing services are used. Not supported by all services.
maxRoutingResponses | Number | Number of trip proposals to be returned
numOfTravelers | Number | Number of travelers. Not supported by all services.
numOfLuggage | Number | Number of luggage pieces Not supported by all services.
useTrafficSituation | Boolean | If set to true, the current road traffic conditions are considered in the route calculation. In case of public transport, trip results are per default as real-time as possible.

Watch the metaData for use of unsupported attributes.

HTTP Headers:
- Accept-Language: This header specifies the language of the trip proposals. Examples: de-DE, en-US. The default language is English. The supported languages depend on the individual services. Not all information may be translated from the default language of the service. The language setting of this request is also used to answer the trip proposal details request, because the system caches the data for this purpose.

Notes:
- Some services also provide  routes in the past.
- Travel times for some trafficTypes may contain extra times. Example: 2 minutes set-up time and 1 minute return time for free-floating car sharing and bike sharing; 2 minutes set-up time and 0 minutes return time for station-based car and bike sharing, 5 minutes parking time for free-floating car sharing and own car.

    [List of Trip Proposals with Basic Info. Intermodal Router][]


## Trip Proposal with Detailed Info [/imp-endpoint/api/V2/TripProposals/IMR/{proposalId}]

A single trip proposal object with detailed information. A trip proposal consists of one or more segments, each segment has one trafficType. 
Successive segments may have the same trafficType. Each segment has an origin and a destination with corresponding timestamps when to arrive and depart.
A segment can contain a a sequence of wayPoints and guidingPoints.
A wayPoint describes an intermediate geo location useful for displaying a trip course in a map.
A guidingPoint can be an intermediate public transport station or a turn-by-turn instruction. It gives a traveler hints on how to travel, e.g. whenever to change the road at a crossing. GuidingPoints are a subset of wayPoints.

The data structure of the trip proposal with detailed info contains the following attributes:

attribute | json data type | comments
--- | --- | ---
url | URI | URI to request more details
segments | Array of Objects | List of route segments
--- | --- | ---
segmentId | Number | Index of segment
description | String | Description of the segment provided by the service provider.
origin | Object | Start point of the segment. 
destination | Object | End point of the segment
trafficType | Enum | Traffic type used in the segment. Range of values are Train, RegioTrain, CityTrain, Metro, Tram, Bus, Ferry, Walk, Car, Bike, Other, and Unknown. Other is used in segments with start/stop procedures for car/bike sharing, car rental, and car parking. 
line | String | line information for a public transport segment
cost | Object | Costs of the segment including distance, duration, price, and CO2 emmision.
wayPoints | Object | List of way points to render the segment in a map. This information is not yet available for all services.
guidingPoints | Object | List of guiding points with intermediate public transport stops or turn-by-turn instructions for walking, cycling, and driving. This information is not yet available for all services.

For a car and bike-sharing-segments "operatorId" and "unitId" are provided. For public transport segments "stationId", and "direction" are provided. For Train, RegionTrain, and CityTrain, and Metro-segments "platform" and "expectedPlatform" may be provided.


Note: The trip proposals as returned by *[POST /imp-endpoint/api/V2/TripProposals/IMR]* are internally stored only for a certain time; afterward they expire and details are no longer available. The current expiration time is 10 minutes. Trip proposals can be based on real-time-data and should not be kept longer than necesseary.
